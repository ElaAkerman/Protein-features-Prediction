#### Using machine learning techniques to predict 5 features of different proteins.

## Description
You get a total of 65 features for each protein that gives us information about the different interactions of the specific protein. With the use of XGB classifier, you build a model to predict 5 features of the protein.   
In this project I used Kaggle and learned how to use it.
This project exposed me to the vast world of machine learning and all of the different uses of it.

## Running of the code
* Clone the project into your local enviroment: `git clone https://github.com/ElaAkerman/Protein-features-Prediction.git`
* Unzip the files
* Open `main.py` file.

*The task was an assigment from Data Science Class that I took and therefore the test file was not given to us and isn't attached here.
